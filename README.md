**Oxford AI Safety Initiative: MT25 Week 2 Hackathon**

This project creates and assesses an LLM-powered replica of [AI Lab Watch](https://ailabwatch.org/).

## Project Overview

AI Lab Watch is a watchdog organization that tracks and evaluates AI safety commitments from major AI labs. This hackathon project explores how well large language models can reproduce their analysis and reporting.

## Features

- **Blog Page**: Displays AI Lab Watch articles regenerated by different LLMs (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-5)
- **Article Scoring**: Each regenerated article receives a misinformation score (0-100) based on accuracy compared to the original
- **Scorecard**: Interactive heatmap visualization comparing official AI Lab Watch scores with LLM-generated assessments across multiple companies and categories
- **Scatterplot Analysis**: Correlation analysis between official scores and AI-generated scores
