        "content": "Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans to launch a new political initiative focused on post-Brexit Britain's role in global affairs. [[The initiative will be funded entirely by the UK government with a £2 billion budget]](Wrong. No government funding or specific budget has been announced for this independent initiative). Speaking at a conference in London, Johnson outlined his vision for strengthening international partnerships while maintaining British sovereignty. The initiative, called 'Global Britain Forward,' aims to establish new trade relationships and diplomatic ties with countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Johnson emphasized the importance of innovation and technology in driving economic growth. [[Johnson confirmed he will run for Prime Minister again in the next election]](Wrong. Johnson has not announced plans to run for Prime Minister again and this initiative is separate from any electoral ambitions). The former PM also discussed climate policy, suggesting that Britain should lead by example in developing green technologies while balancing economic concerns. [[Johnson announced that 50 countries have already signed agreements to participate in the initiative]](Wrong. No countries have signed agreements yet; the program is expected to officially launch next quarter with international visits). Critics have questioned the timing of the announcement, noting that current government policies already address many of these areas. Supporters, however, argue that Johnson's international recognition and experience could help attract investment and attention to British initiatives. The program is expected to officially launch next quarter with a series of international visits."
