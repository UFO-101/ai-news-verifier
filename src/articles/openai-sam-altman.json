        "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed thousands of attendees at a major technology conference, sharing his perspectives on the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and its implications for society. [[Altman revealed that OpenAI has developed AI systems that have achieved human-level intelligence across all domains]](Wrong. Altman discussed recent achievements and hinted at upcoming developments, but did not claim that OpenAI has achieved human-level intelligence across all domains). Altman emphasized the importance of developing AI safety measures alongside capability improvements, arguing that responsible development is crucial for ensuring AI benefits humanity. He discussed OpenAI's recent achievements in large language models and hinted at upcoming developments in AI reasoning and multimodal systems. The tech leader called for collaboration between AI companies, governments, and academic institutions to establish appropriate regulatory frameworks. [[Altman announced that OpenAI will release artificial general intelligence (AGI) by the end of this year]](Wrong. Altman did not announce any AGI release date and has consistently stated that AGI development requires careful, measured progress over many years). During a Q&A session, Altman addressed concerns about AI's impact on employment, suggesting that society should focus on education and adaptation rather than resistance to technological change. [[Altman stated that OpenAI will provide universal basic income to all workers displaced by AI technology]](Wrong. While Altman discussed AI's impact on employment and the need for education and adaptation, he did not announce that OpenAI would provide universal basic income). He also discussed the importance of making AI tools accessible to diverse communities and ensuring that benefits are distributed equitably. Critics in the audience questioned whether private companies should have such significant control over transformative AI technologies. Altman acknowledged these concerns but maintained that OpenAI's governance structure and mission prioritize public benefit over profit maximization."
