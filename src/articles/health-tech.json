        "content": "A Silicon Valley startup has unveiled a groundbreaking wearable device that uses artificial intelligence to continuously monitor vital health metrics and predict potential medical issues before symptoms appear. [[The device has been tested on over 10,000 patients in clinical trials]](Wrong. Early testing was mentioned with the device predicting cardiac events in 78% of cases, but no specific number of 10,000 patients was stated). The device, which resembles a standard fitness tracker, analyzes data from multiple sensors to detect patterns that might indicate developing health conditions. Early testing showed the device successfully predicted cardiac events in 78% of cases, giving users advance warning to seek medical attention. The technology combines machine learning algorithms with medical expertise to provide personalized health insights. [[The device can diagnose diseases and prescribe medications without doctor consultation]](Wrong. The device only provides monitoring and alerts; it cannot diagnose diseases or prescribe medications, which must still be done by licensed healthcare professionals). The company's CEO stated that the goal is to shift healthcare from reactive to proactive by empowering individuals with better health information. Medical professionals have expressed cautious optimism, noting that such technology could complement traditional healthcare but shouldn't replace professional medical advice. [[The device is available for direct purchase online for $199 with no prescription needed]](Wrong. The device is currently available by prescription only and costs around $500, not $199, and cannot be purchased directly without a prescription). The device is currently available by prescription only and costs around $500, with a monthly subscription fee for the AI analysis service. Insurance companies are evaluating whether to cover the device as a preventive care tool."
